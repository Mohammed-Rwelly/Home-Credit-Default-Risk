Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)

Performed Optimized for choosing the best algorithm amongst LogisticRegression ,RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier, XBoost is currently the best chosen model with accuracy 92% on test data .
